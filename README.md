# KNN-Implementation </br>
<b>Implementing KNN algorithm to classify patients into three different classes-  Underweight, Normal and Obese </b>

Imagine there is a dietitian available in a clinic to recommend suitable dietary plans to patients</br>
Main metrics used by the dietician for the recommendation is Body Mass Index, Age and Gender</br>
Body Mass Index =  Weight in kgs / Height in metres ^ 2 </br>
Our use case is to accurately predict a Label that can be assigned to a particular patient at any given time in the categories of ‘Obese’, ‘Underweight’ and ‘Normal’ </br>
Features Data (Independent): Body Mass Index, Age and Gender </br>
Predictor or Target Variable (Dependent): Labels </br>
